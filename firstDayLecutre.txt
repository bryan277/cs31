Data-recorded facts and numbers

Database- structure used to hold or store Data

Database application - a program that serves as an intermediary between user and DBMS

relational Database - used structured data and ACID
transactions
A-Atomicity
C-Consistency
I-Isolation
D-Durability

Concurrency - when multiple users modify the same data at the same time

DBMS-software used to create, process, and administer the database

NoSQL Database - used for massive amounts of unstructured data(used for big data)

Primary key - a unique identifier for each row

Composite key - a key composed of more than one column

Surrogate key - a primary key automatically generate and assigned by the database

foreign key - provides the link between two tables i.e. creates a relationship between the two tables

information - knowledge derived from data, data presented in a meaningful context, data processed by summing, averaging grouping, or other similar operations(DBMS software used)

metadata - data concerning the structure of the data that are used to describe tables, columns, indexes, etc.


Problems w/ file-processing systems
-data is separated and isolated
-data is often duplicated
-application program dependent
-slow
-not secure

DBMS solutions
-data is integrated
-data duplication is reduced
-DBM is application independent
-stored data can be shared
-security restrictions


Online transactions processing system(OLTP)
-an operational database system available for and dictated to, transactions processing

Data warehouse - a store of enterprise data that is designated to facilitate management decision making

Cape Codd tables
RETAIL_ORDER(orderNumber, StoreNumber, StoreZip, OrderMonth, OrderYear, OrderTotal)
ORDER_ITEM(OrderNumber, SKU, Quantity, Price, ExtendedPrice)

Schema - complete logical view of the database, continuing all tables, columns, primary keys and foreign keys
