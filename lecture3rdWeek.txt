-- Functional Dependency - a relationship between columns in which one column or group of columns determines the value of the other

Determinant - one or more columns that functionally determine another column or columns

Notation
X -> Y
X determines Y
or
Y is functionally dependent on X
Y = x + 3, x-> y
cookieCost = numberOfBoxes * $f
extendedPrice = quantity * unitPrice


composite determinant - a determinant composed of more than one column

Decomposition Rule - if A ->(B,C), then A -> B and B -> C

Union Rule - if A -> B and A -> C, then A -> (B, C))

First Table SKU
SKU -> All other columns
SKU -> (SKU_Description, Department, Buyer)
SKU_Description => All other columns
Buyer -> Department

Second Table patient_prescription
(MedName, PatientID, Date) -> All other columns

WHERE - specifies which rows are displayed


A relation is a two dimensional array with the following characteristics
-rows contain data about an entity
-columns contain data about attributes of the entities
-all entries in a column are of the same kind
-each column has a unique name
-cells of the table hold a single value
-order of columns/rows in unimportant
-no two rows are identical


entity- something identifiable that users want to track
attributes(column) - columns of a relation
tuples = rows of a relation

superkey - a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies any row in a relation

candidate key - the candidate key defined to the DBMS to be primary key

Surrogate key - an artificial column added by the DBMS to serve as a primary key for the table

foreign key - is a column or composite of columns that is the primary key of another table

domain integrity constraint - a data constraint that limits data to a specific set of values

entity integrity constraint - a primary key must have unique values for every row

referential integrity constraint - a statement that limits the values of the foreign key to matching values of the primary key in the reference table.
